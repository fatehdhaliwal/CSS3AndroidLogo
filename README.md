===============

Making an android logo using CSS3

Following tutorial found at http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo

Found tutorial using the odin project.

Also first time trying to use git/github so not entirely sure if I'm syncing/commiting properly at the time. Hopefully it all works out though.
